Gcode operations:
    Move left and right servos
        In radians or in degrees?
    Move left and right steppers
        Absolute or relative? Some 3D printers have both
    Move bed up and down
    Homing operation (reset left/right steppers, calibrate)
    Probing operation (read from probe and record output)
        Record contact/net names? If so, the gcode parser will need to be rewritten to support strings
    Start/end of stream

Other considerations:
    Does this need to be gcode? Could a binary format work better?
    Do we want to specify a coordinate set and have the microcontroller do the work, or should the plotter do that work first?
        i.e. should the gcode be higher level or lower level?
        Plotter has more processing power than is available to the microcontroller, but has to think ahead (i.e. no runtime information, all compile-time)
    How do we move multiple components at once?
        Implement some asynchronous system, i.e. an event loop with a set tick rate.
        Use timer interrupts
        SHOULD we even move multiple components at once?
        Which takes precedent: the steppers or the servos?
    How do we ensure one probe is always on the left and the other is always on the right?
        Add runtime checks?
        Move both probes at once with a single gcode instruction
            i.e. specify two sets of coordinates and let the microcontroller handle it

Planned operations:
    Move to coordinate set
    Raise/lower bed
    Read from probes
    Set calibration information
        Homing
        Set servo basis
        Set stepper basis
        Set stepper ratio (steps per mm)

TODO also: Check if a gcode standard already exists for PCB probers/plotters
